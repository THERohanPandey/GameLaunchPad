# 🌐 Website UI Design Prototype

Hi! I'm Rohan — primarily a **Front-End Developer**, but I'm always exploring the design side of web development too.

This is a simple UI prototype I created for practice and to develop my personal website. It includes basic layout and visual concepts for a clean, user-friendly web experience.

## 📄 Pages Included

- **Home Page**
- **About Page**
- **Statistics**
- **Success Page**

## 📌 Why I Made This

As a developer, I believe understanding **user experience and design thinking** is just as important as writing clean code. This project helped me apply that mindset.

If you like the layout or find it useful, feel free to use it or take inspiration from it for your own projects.

Thanks for checking it out!  
Let’s build something great together.
